#LeetCode(206) : Reverse Linked List

Description :
Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

##Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
##Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

Follow up:
A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

Hint : Draw list and assume part of it is reversed and the other part is not
then define 3 pointers prev , curr , next
